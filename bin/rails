# TOTAL HACK!! Due to a change in the startup process, the working
# directory is changed before Rack can find config.ru; this means
# we have to supply the location of this config file _every time_.
# But of course it's not that easy: we also have to require the files
# in which the constants live to actually set the location as a default
# option so that we can actually do it at this point, since there's no
# other place to interrupt the boot process.
